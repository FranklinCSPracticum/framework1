# CSS Framework Integration Project

Welcome to the CSS Framework Integration Project! In this project, you will have
the opportunity to showcase your CSS skills by integrating a CSS framework of
your choice into the existing login component and improving its visual
appearance. This project aims to test your understanding of CSS, HTML, version
control (Git), and collaborative development through pull requests.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Fork this repository by clicking the "Fork" button on the top right corner of
   this page. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following
   command:

```
git clone <your-forked-repository-url>
```

3. Create a new branch to work on your changes. You can use the following
   command to create a new branch:

```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

4. Choose a CSS framework of your choice (e.g., Bootstrap, Bulma, Tailwind CSS)
   and add it to the project. You can either link to a CDN or install the
   framework locally.
5. Open the `framework.html` file and apply the CSS framework classes and styles
   to the existing login component. Your goal is to match or improve the visual
   appearance of the login component using the selected CSS framework.
6. Make regular commits as you make progress on your styling changes. It's a
   good practice to commit small changes with descriptive commit messages.
7. Once you are satisfied with your login page design, push your branch to your
   forked repository:

```
git push origin <branch-name>
```

8. Open a pull request from your branch to the original repository. Provide a
   descriptive title and a clear description of the changes you made.

## Contribution Guidelines

framework integration, you're welcome to do so! Follow these guidelines to make

3. Commit and push your changes to your forked repository.
